## Slide 3: Introduction to Angular Routing
**Content**:  
- **What is Angular Routing?**: Client-side navigation for Single Page Applications (SPAs).  
- **Role of `@angular/router`**: Manages navigation, URL updates, and component rendering.  
- **Benefits**:  
  - Seamless user experience without page reloads.  
  - Modular app structure with lazy loading.  
  - Performance optimization via dynamic routing.  
- **Angular 18 Context**: Enhanced standalone component support and `provideRouter`.  
**Visuals**: Diagram of SPA navigation (browser URL → `<router-outlet>` → component).  
**Speaker Notes**:  
- "Routing is the backbone of Angular apps, enabling dynamic navigation."  
- "Angular 18 simplifies routing with standalone APIs, which we’ll explore."  
**Purpose**: Provide context and highlight routing’s importance.

## Slide 4: Setting Up Angular Routing
**Content**:  
- **Steps**:  
  - Use `provideRouter` in `app.config.ts` for standalone apps.  
  - Define routes in a `routes` array.  
  - Add `<router-outlet>` in the root component template.  
- **CLI Command**: `ng generate component home --standalone`  
- **Example**: Basic route setup.  
**Visuals**: Code snippet with syntax highlighting.  
**Speaker Notes**:  
- "Angular 18’s standalone APIs simplify routing setup compared to NgModules."  
- "We use `provideRouter` to configure routes globally."  
**Purpose**: Show the modern Angular 18 routing setup.

## Slide 5: Route Properties
**Content**:  
- **Key Properties**:  
  - `path`: URL segment (e.g., `users/:id`).  
  - `component`: Component to render.  
  - `pathMatch`: `prefix` or `full` for matching.  
  - `redirectTo`: Redirects to another route.  
  - `data`: Static data for the route.  
  - `children`: Nested routes.  
  - `loadComponent`: Lazy-load standalone components.  
- **Example**: Nested routes with lazy loading.  
**Visuals**: Diagram of route hierarchy (dashboard → profile).  
**Speaker Notes**:  
- "Route properties define how URLs map to components."  
- "Angular 18’s `loadComponent` enables lazy loading without modules."  
**Purpose**: Explain the building blocks of route configuration.

## Slide 6: Activated Route
**Content**:  
- **What is `ActivatedRoute`?**: Service to access route information (params, query params, data).  
- **Access Methods**:  
  - `snapshot`: Static data at route activation.  
  - `paramMap`/`queryParamMap`: Observables for dynamic updates.  
- **Use Case**: Display user ID from URL.  
**Visuals**: Code snippet and mockup of profile page output.  
**Speaker Notes**:  
- "Use `ActivatedRoute` to access dynamic route data."  
- "Observables are preferred for reactive updates in Angular 18."  
**Purpose**: Show how to retrieve and use route data.

## Slide 7: Route Guards
**Content**:  
- **Types**:  
  - `CanActivate`: Control access to a route.  
  - `CanDeactivate`: Prevent leaving a route (e.g., unsaved changes).  
  - `CanLoad`: Protect lazy-loaded modules.  
  - `CanActivateChild`: Guard child routes.  
- **Use Cases**: Authentication, form protection.  
- **Example**: `CanActivate` for authentication.  
**Visuals**: Flowchart of guard decision (allow/deny navigation).  
**Speaker Notes**:  
- "Angular 18 uses functional guards for simpler, type-safe logic."  
- "Guards are essential for securing routes."  
**Purpose**: Explain how to control navigation.

## Slide 8: Route Resolvers
**Content**:  
- **What is a Resolver?**: Pre-fetches data before route activation.  
- **Benefits**: Ensures data availability, improves UX.  
- **Example**: Fetch user data.  
**Visuals**: Diagram of resolver fetching data before component load.  
**Speaker Notes**:  
- "Resolvers ensure data is ready before rendering."  
- "Angular 18’s functional resolvers simplify dependency injection."  
**Purpose**: Highlight data pre-fetching.

## Slide 9: Router Events
**Content**:  
- **What are Router Events?**: Observables for navigation lifecycle (e.g., `NavigationStart`, `NavigationEnd`).  
- **Use Cases**: Analytics, loading spinners.  
- **Example**: Log navigation events.  
**Visuals**: Timeline of router events (start → end).  
**Speaker Notes**:  
- "Router events let you track navigation for analytics or UI updates."  
- "Use RxJS to filter specific events."  
**Purpose**: Show how to monitor navigation.

## Slide 10: Error Handling and Redirects
**Content**:  
- **Invalid Routes**: Use wildcard route (`**`) for 404 pages.  
- **Redirects**: `redirectTo` for default or fallback routes.  
- **Example**: 404 page and redirect.  
**Visuals**: Mockup of 404 page.  
**Speaker Notes**:  
- "Wildcard routes handle invalid URLs gracefully."  
- "Redirects ensure users land on valid routes."  
**Purpose**: Cover edge cases in routing.

## Slide 11: Testing Routes and Guards
**Content**:  
- **Tools**: `RouterTestingModule`, Jasmine, Karma.  
- **Testing Routes**: Mock navigation and verify component rendering.  
- **Testing Guards**: Simulate guard logic.  
- **Example**: Test an `authGuard`.  
**Visuals**: Code snippet with test output.  
**Speaker Notes**:  
- "Testing ensures robust routing logic."  
- "Angular 18’s `RouterTestingModule` simplifies route testing."  
**Purpose**: Demonstrate testing strategies.

## Slide 12: Practical Example - Route Configuration
**Content**:  
- **Demo**: Parent/child routes with lazy loading.  
**Visuals**: Route hierarchy diagram and navigation mockup.  
**Speaker Notes**:  
- "This sets up a dashboard with lazy-loaded profile routes."  
- "Navigate to `/dashboard/profile/1` to see the lazy-loaded component."  
**Purpose**: Show practical route setup.

## Slide 13: Practical Example - Activated Route and Resolvers
**Content**:  
- **Demo**: Fetch and display user data using a resolver.  
**Visuals**: Mockup of profile page with resolved data.  
**Speaker Notes**:  
- "The resolver ensures data is available before rendering."  
- "Use `ActivatedRoute` for dynamic params and resolved data."  
**Purpose**: Demonstrate dynamic data handling.

## Slide 14: Practical Example - Route Guards
**Content**:  
- **Demo**: Protect dashboard with `authGuard` and prevent leaving edit page with `CanDeactivate`.  
**Visuals**: Mockup of confirmation prompt for unsaved changes.  
**Speaker Notes**:  
- "Guards protect routes and prevent unintended navigation."  
- "Angular 18’s functional guards are concise and powerful."  
**Purpose**: Show guard implementation.

## Slide 15: Best Practices and Performance Tips
**Content**:  
- **Best Practices**:  
  - Use clear, semantic route paths (e.g., `users/:id` vs. `u/:id`).  
  - Leverage standalone components for modular routing.  
  - Keep guards lightweight and cleanup subscriptions.  
- **Performance Tips**:  
  - Use `loadComponent` for lazy loading to reduce bundle size.  
  - Avoid heavy logic in resolvers to prevent delays.  
- **Pitfalls**:  
  - Overusing guards can complicate navigation.  
  - Forgetting to handle wildcard routes leads to poor UX.
